My learning was focused on fetching data from the Pokemon API url and manipulating that data on the DOM. 

Optimizations

I am still working to optimize my functions - I intend to create smaller functions that focus on one particular task, for better readability and reusability.

Lessons Learned:

I learned that functions that are too long make it difficult to pinpoint why our code isn't working sometimes - by using smaller functions that focus on one particular task, we can reuse these functions throughout our code. This also makes it easier to add new features to our code.
